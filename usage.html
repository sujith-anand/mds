            Hierarchy
        </h2>
        <p>When designing an application, it's crucial to establish a clear hierarchy of colors. This ensures that there is a consistent and cohesive visual language throughout the application. To establish hierachy visually in the MDS use the lighter shades (color values less than or equal to 200) to display the hierarchy of colors. Below show how you can establish hierarchy

        <h2>Color Meaning
        </h2>
        <p>Color can communicate the meaning of different UI elements. Blue indicates information Green indicates positive action, yellow indicates a warning, and red indicates negative action. However, these could be perceived differently in different situations. It's important to consider the context in which colors are used. Here is an interesting example, if you are building a dashboard to indicate spend management and if the value of your spend increases, it's not positive and should be indicated with red. But on the other hand, if your profit increases, it is a positive situation and has to be indicated in green. Understanding the context is very important before using any color.

        <h2>State
        </h2>
        <p>Color can provide information about the state of an app, its components, and elements. This includes: Current state of an element or component, such as whether a button is enabled or disabled
            <ul>

                <li> Changes in state to an app, component, or element.</li>
                <li> Color should be noticeable when indicating state changes, as subtle differences in color may be missed
                </li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h2>User Screen vs Candidate screens
        </h2>
        <p>The color of the Nav bar and its Content's will be changed to different between User screens and Candidate screens. Candidate screen will be applicable to the applications like the policy hub candidate facing screens
            <ul>
    
                <li> Nav bar for the user screens will not have any change and background will be having Mitra Blue 500 and contents will be white default
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="Images/User Screen.png">
                </li>
                <li> Nav Bars for the candidate screens will have the white background and text color will be Mitra Blue 700. We recommend using colored logos for the candidate screens
